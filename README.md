# ! WORK IN PROGRESS !
## Purpose:
Quickly spin up an environment for both reverse engineering and for malware development. 

This tool requires `ansible`:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html 


## Usage:
1. Change the IP in `inventory.yml` to that of your workstation.
2. Run the commands in `winrm.txt` on said workstation.
3. Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml main.yml`

Windows Defender is finncky so if you want a hard "OFF" do:
1. `msconfig` -> safe made on -> reboots
2. Run `C:\DisableDefender.ps1` in powershell
3. `msconfig` -> safe made off -> reboots

## Current Abilities
- Installs various tooling that can be easily seen in `roles/revndev/defaults/main.yml`.
- Removes annoying bloatware from the system.

## To Do:
- Seperate tooling
- More tooling
